This page is primarily intended for me to keep track of and organize my GitHub repositories into meaningful units. Somewhere along the way when implementing this idea I thought that this page could serve me well both to organize not only GitHub repos but any other college and non-college related work and projects and to show someone else my areas of interest along with some demo apps. Particularly, my area of interest is application of machine learning and deep learning concepts and models in the field of computer vision. Having my bachelor thesis done in the given field. In my free time I like learning new stuff about Android and iOS apps development tools. Having that in my mind, this page will be organized into sections which are not yet defined but will be as I progress with this idea.
